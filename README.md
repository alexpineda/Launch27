# Launch27
Launch27 Unofficial Android App
Proof of concept

Uses Launch27 API as well as some hacks.
Reason for hacks: Login API requires a API token. Catch 22. So instead
we use the HTML end point to login, and grab the API token from the admin HTML.
Afterwards we can use the token to use the JSON api for remaining functionality.

I'm new to Android so the UI is going to need a lot of work, obviously.
